Data Analytics Project: Group 3 Seattle House Prices

Catarina Batista, Gabriel Escarrer, Sanmi Ogunmola

For this project we were tasked with building a regression model in order to predict future house prices based on a variety of features on which the value of the houses were evaluated upon. We made some initial assumptions about which features would affect the price point. These included location, size, construction year and sold dates. After having tested and trained our model with various approaches, not all of the assumptions were conclusive enough to validate our initial assumptions. 

After having better understood the features we were dealing with, we decided to take a different approach, this time, taking into consideration those features who had a bigger influence on the our targeted outcome, the price. 
Furthermore, we dove into the intricacies of how well the model predicted the price of those houses in the higher price bracket and also extracted which features were more conclusive in this assesmet.

Overall, we discovered grade, location, and the square foot of the living area have positive affect on predicting house prices and were some of the main features to determine if a house would be expensive or not.

In order to better understand out thought proccess, we have uploaded different documents which reflect various types of information related to our project.
