Data Analytics Project: Group 3 Seattle House Prices

Catarina Batista, Gabriel Escarrer, Sanmi Ogunmola

For this project, we chose the linear regression model output: regression_data_clean.csv.

Initially, for the project we have made some assumptions for the model, in which location, size, age and date would play an important part for the model prediction. However, as we were testing and training the model taking different approaches, not all of the assumptions were conclusive to validate and improve our model's accuracy.


For this project we were tasked with building a regression model in order to predict future house prices based on a variety of features on which the value of the houses were evaluated upon.

Initially, we decided to make some assumptions for the model, in which location, size, age of the house and selling dates would play a central role in the model. After having tested and trained our model with various approaches, not all of the assumptions were conclusive enough to validate our initial assumptions. After having better understood the features we were dealing with, we decided to take a different approach, this time, taking into consideration those features who had a bigger influence on the our targeted outcome, the price. Furthermore, we dove into the intricacies of how well the model predicted the price of those houses in the higher price bracket and also extracted which features were more conclusive in this assesmet. Overall we have concluded that in fact, considering certain features such as grade, size or "position" does have positive influence on how our model is able to predict future selling prices... something to end with?
