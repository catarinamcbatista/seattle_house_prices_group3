# seattle_house_prices_group3
Data Analytics Project: Group 3 Seattle House Prices

For this project, we chose the linear regression model output: regression_data_clean.csv.

Initially, for the project we have made some assumptions for the model, in which location, size, age and date would play an important part for the model prediction. However, as we were testing and training the model taking different approaches, not all of the assumptions were conclusive to validate and improve our model's accuracy.
